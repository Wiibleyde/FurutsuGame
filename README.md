## Usage

The goal of the game is to win more points as possible before losing.
To win points, you have to drop fruits on the ground and make them collide with the same fruits and create better fruits (for example, if you drop a cherry on a cherry, you will get a strawberry).
To lose, you have to let the fruits reach the top of the game area.

To play the game :
- Use the arrow keys to move
- Use the space bar to drop fruits
